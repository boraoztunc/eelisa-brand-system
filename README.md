# EELISA — Brand System

This repository contains the agent-readable brand system for EELISA, generated and maintained with [Brand IDE](https://brandide.app).

## What this is

Every file in this repo is a **brand chunk**: a self-contained piece of brand knowledge with a structured YAML header that AI agents can parse and retrieve. Same brand, two formats — human-readable and agent-readable simultaneously.

## How to use it

### In Claude Code or Cursor

Add this to your system prompt or `.cursorrules`:

```
Load brand context from the eelisa-brand-system-6 GitHub repo before any brand or content task.
Start with positioning/brand-positioning.yaml and messaging/voice-core.md.
Consult _retrieval-rules.yaml to find the right chunks for your specific task.
```

### File structure

└── guardrails/
    ├── constraints-messaging.yaml   # What this brand never says
    └── constraints-visual.yaml      # What this brand never shows
```

## Agents

This brand system includes 1 configured agent:

- **Arty** — `agents/arty/`

Each agent has three files: `identity.md`, `soul.md`, and `principles.md`.

## Maintaining this system

Open this repo in [Brand IDE](https://brandide.app) to edit files with validation, token counting, and commit history. Every save creates a commit so you have a full version history.
